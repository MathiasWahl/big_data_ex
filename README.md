### Setup
We have followed the recommended setup method for Spark (pyspark) and used Pycharm as IDE. Our group used Linux and MacOS, however there were some Spark functions we were unable to run on MacOS (such as count() and limit(). We also had some problems with Spark not supporting some versions of Java and Python. To run the code we had to add the Spark directory as a content root in Project Structure in the PyCharm settings as shown below.
